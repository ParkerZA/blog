#### Climbing Mountains
##### Or: Achieving your goals

90% of the things I say amount to unfiltered nonsense devoid of any logic or rationale, but occasionally I'll say something insighful and not completely stupid. This blog is an attempt to distill aforementioned nonsense into the good bits and present them to you in a condensed, marketable format. Anyway...

Think back to the last time you were hanging off a monkey bar, or doing chin-ups, or anything that required hanging by the grip of your fingers.
Can you remember the eventual pain that settled into your palm? The way your fingers bent at odd angles afterwards? The burn marks? How long you were able to hold on? If you weigh as much as I do... not very long. Ugh, gravity, am I right?

Cool, cool.

Now, imagine climbing this:

![El Capitan](https://www.climbing.com/.image/t_share/MTY1NjYzODIzNjM2NzM1MjYz/screen-shot-2019-07-22-at-20635-pm.png)

That beautiful rock formation is El Capitan, located in Yosemite National Park. It's about 3,000 feet high, which is slighly taller than the Burj Khalifa's 2,717 feet. 

So it's pretty tall. I'd ask it how's the weather up there but it's a mountain.

Anyway, believe it or not, someone actually did climb it. This guy: 

![Crazy person](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53ff4a5ce4b0946dd6956d37/1496606617260-XYTPGFG1BQX3SFWJRGEM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kM7JWRAez_DNbkdXTPMIY4l7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UU2lKe9kfZK9dglgbDsBbYXgHjmXAxWO93qOhDSwVWrbWieZYhKLfbDz4wx93c0-vg/alex-honnold-freerider-climb.adapt.1900.1.jpg?format=2500w)

His name is Alex Honnold, a 34-year-old man who has made a career out of elevating his massive balls a 1,000 feet above sea level.

Not only did he climb El Capitan in just 3 hours and 56 minutes, he did it *free hand* and without any protective equipment whatsoever.

I need to get across to you how insane that is.

One tiny slip, one momentary lapse in judgement or concentration, and he plummets to his easily avoidable death. I say easily avoidable because holy shit why are you climbing a mountain free hand? Aren't there easier ways to kill yourself? Has mankind finally reached an evolutionary apex that has allowed us to give natural selection the middle finger?

And this isn't a leisurely hike up Table Mountain, or indoor rock climbing, where there are steadfast harnesses in place and protrusions for your hands to use. We're talking a 90 degree climb, with barely an inch of rock to hold onto.

I say all this to impress upon you just what an incredible achievement this is. His feat is arguably the greatest athletic accomplishment of all time.

You're of course at this point wondering what any of this has to do with accomplishing your goals, or anything really. 

![Life goals](https://media.mpasho.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/life-goals-meme.jpg)

The answer is that it's a metaphor. Or something.

It's a shitty metaphor.

About two years ago I started setting concrete goals for myself, mostly out of necessity. At this point I also realized that I had no idea what I was doing. My goal (becoming a web developer, mainly) seemed to me a mirage, far away in the distance. Visible, but frustratingly unobtainable. I knew where I wanted to go, where I needed to be, but the path before me was like a maze. Going down one road invariably led me back the way I came. Every wrong move was time wasted. And while I was moving forward, it wasn't at the pace that I wanted. I knew I had to change something about myself if I wanted to progress.

I know I wasn't the only person looking for direction. There's an entire industry built around self-improvement, both mental and physical. People need guidance on fundamental things such as losing weight, avoiding procrastination (you won't believe how long I've procrastinated writing this), making money, being sociable, making friends, being happy, even seeking to change the way they think and percieve their reality. And while some of these may seem easy or trivial, the truth is that their circumstances and life experiences have merely allowed them to subconsciously formulate a mental blueprint to accomplish their goals.

![Every. Time.](https://i.insider.com/5b7edeb1b354cd32108b5745?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp)

Most people, I should think, never have to face this problem. Their goals are finite and digestible. Want to be an engineer? Cool, go to university for four years, pass and you'll be an engineer (though the "passing" part is another story).

But what if what you're trying to accomplish doesn't fit neatly into a predetermined pathway? What if it's something more imprecise and ill-defined like, say, becoming rich? There's no road map to follow. There's no step-by-step instructions to becoming wealthy. You kind of have to figure it out on your own.

That's probably an extreme example, but you get the point. You have a goal in mind, but no idea what to do next.

I think a lot of people set goals for themselves, but then they don't know how to go about actualizing them. They just have this vague, general idea of what they need to do. I'll just work really, really hard, and it'll eventually figure itself out. That's the purgatory I lived in for a while.

![The purgatory I lived in for a while](https://05714042a2232aa91807ef46-qgjpdebgroop4m.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Purgatory-768x308.jpg)
###### The purgatory I lived in for a while

It doesn't work, unfortunately. You need definition in order to gain direction. Otherwise you're just flailing around in the dark. Sure, you might stumble onto the light switch eventually, but wouldn't you rather have sex with the lights off? I'm not good at metaphors.

You could say to someone, "Losing weight is easy! Just eat less and exercise more!" And that person will probably try to eat you. In most cases, simplifying a problem by condensing the mission statement into a couple of sentences doesn't really simplify anything. It just causes aggravation, because if everything is so simple, why is it still so difficult? 


But that's the thing, isn't it? Simple != easy. And that's okay. It's how it should be. Nothing worth accomplishing is easy, otherwise it wouldn't really be much of an accomplishment.


Just to be clear, I haven't accomplished much or anything truly noteworthy, besides reaching one of my main goals. But I believe this information, which I've gleaned from people much, much smarter than me, can be helpful to anybody in the same predicament I was in.

Cool?

Let's go back to El Capitan and Alex. When he was standing at the foot of the mountain, staring into the sky and his eventual destination, what do you think was going through his head? Again, the challenge here is very simple (climb the mountain), but... how? How the fuck?

If you've made it this far, well done, and here's the prize: Ever heard the saying "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step?"

What about "Rome wasn't built in a day"?

Of course you've heard them, everyone has. But, well... that's the secret. Really. That's all there is to it.

It's possible that you just wasted a couple minutes of your time while I talked utter nonsense, but stick with me. 

These proverbs have stood the test of time for a reason. The first one originates all the way back from the 6th century BC. And sure, you've heard them peddled all the time as motivational quotes on Facebook, but have you really unpacked what they were trying to say?

Turns out, all Alex had to do was take that first step. He put his fingers in a crack in the mountain, lifted himself up, reached for the next crack and rinse repeat till he got to the top. But the important thing to take away from this is that he took it one, small step at a time. He didn't reach for the next ledge or make any move until he was 100% sure that it was the correct one. His life depended on it.

But I didn't I say earlier that simplification is not helpful? How is this any different?

Because it's not simplification. Not really.

![Divide-and-conquer](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/98c02634ee7f970a6bfb0812cc1495bacb462282.png)

In computer science this concept exists as an algorithm called the Divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by breaking down a problem into smaller problems, then breaking those problems into smaller problems (recursion. Like Inception), and so on, until the problems are simple enough to be solved on their own. So by essentially taking one large, complex, unsolveable problem and breaking it down into smaller tasks, you develop a solution.

If you were tasked to build, for example, a calculator program, you wouldn't really know where to start. How do I build the user interface? How do I make the answer show up on the screen? How do I make it do maths?

That's the wrong way to tackle the problem. You start off by breaking it down into smaller chunks, work on those independently, and then put all the pieces together again. The trick is to break it down to such an atomic level that you cannot possibly break it down further. So forget about building a user interface and the mathematics. Start simple: how do I accept input? Doesn't matter what it is, numbers or letters. Got that? Great, now how do I store the input? In a variable? Makes sense. Now how do I accept a second input? And so on.

In the steps I've outlined above, not one of those are methods used specifically for building a calcuator. You could build anything with input. You could build Google from that starting point. But as you carry on, and you start connecting the smaller pieces together, a picture will start to take shape. It'll all come together, magestically, like a Megazord.

###### The solution to all your problems

The problem for a lot of people is that these "smaller" problems are not directly related to the main one, and it becomes difficult to obtain a clearer picture of how they all fit together. You need to think abstractly, in order to see the big picture, and granularly, in order to take action.

And that's the really important part: taking action. You can plan and conceptualize all you want, but if you don't take that first step, nothing is going to happen. Just make sure that first step is in the right direction.

This mental model of breaking every step into smaller steps may seem ineffectual, but I promise you, it's incredibly powerful. It could be life-changing even.

Big change doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, often longer than we want it to.

If you'd like some practical, actionable advice, just take it day by day.

If your goal is to learn a new skill, don't fixate on how long it's going to take. If you've started playing guitar, you're not going to see results after a day or even a week of practice. You'll practice for two hours without seeing or hearing any progress, and you'll get despondent, and you'll quit. It's a trap we all fall into. We want results, and we want them fast.

But just focus on what you can accomplish in a day. Nevermind on how good you're getting, or how long it's taking you to get that good. Just think about how much you can *improve*, every day.

If you could improve by just one percent in a day, that doesn't seem like much, right? Hardly getting excited over. But if you keep consistent and soldier on, that one percent grows and grows and grows.

And every one percent is as important as the last.

I hope this piece was in some way insightful. If you can develop this mindset of compartmentalizing your challenges, you will be much better equiped to tackle them.

You won't just climb mountains, you'll leap over them.

And you too, can make a molehill out of a mountain.

P.S. Yes I came up with that closing line first and worked my way backwards.
